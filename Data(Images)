Out data came from pictures taken by our 4 group members. Each of us contributed 12 pictures, so we have a total of 48 pictures. 12 pictures include 3 pictures with 4 emotions (angry, surprised, happy, sad) and no facial coverings, with masks, and with sunglasses. We created two dataframes to test our hypothesis. For one dataframe, we tried to test the relationship between confidence score and emotions. For the other dataframe, we tried to test the relationship between confidence score and facial coverings. 
Details of data we have is below in the folder of Google drive, you can check it if you are interested:
